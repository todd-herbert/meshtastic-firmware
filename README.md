# InkHUD Pure

This branch curates and extends Meshtastic's InkHUD UI in line with the [original design principles](/src/graphics/niche/InkHUD/docs/README.md#design-principles):

> InkHUD is a minimal UI for E-Ink devices. It displays the user's choice of info, as statically as possible, to minimize the amount of display refreshing.
>
> It is intended to supplement a connected client app.
